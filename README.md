## English
Dollphone is an icon pack that is very cute, but isn’t too hyper. The icons avoid overly saturated or dark colors, and softly bulge out the "straight" lines away from the center for a plushie-like look.

Dollphone Icon Pack is a crystallization of years of passion for the “yurukawa” aesthetic.

## 日本語
Dollphone は、かわいいけど元気すぎないアイコンパックです。極彩色や暗い色を避けて、外側に近づくにつれ少しずつ線を膨らませることによって、ぬいぐるみのようなふわっとした触感を演出しています。

Dollphone アイコンパックは、何年もまたいだ『ゆるかわ』への情熱の結晶です。
